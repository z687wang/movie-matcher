# CS 590.7 Mobile App Final Project: Movie Matcher
## Description
A mobile app that allows users to like or dislike a movie by swiping to the left or right; will recommend new movies to users based on their preferences. The app will contain structured data of popular movies and a recommendation algorithm that is able to predict movies based on multiple features including genre, directors, actors, etc. It will also contain a data persistence mechanism that is implemented via saving data onto files or databases.

## WorkFlow
1. User log in
2. A default list of movies is displayed to the user
3. User indicate whether he/she has positive/negative opinion about the movies by swiping left/right
4. As the user swipes, the upcoming movies will match the preference of the user more and more
5. If the user finds a suitable movie to watch, he/she can click a save button to save for future reference
6. After the user exits the app, his/her preference is stored for her next use
